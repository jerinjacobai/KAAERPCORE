# KAA ERP Hub - Project Overview

## 1. Project Description
**KAA ERP Hub** is a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed to streamline business operations. It features a modular architecture, integrating key business functions into a unified platform. The application is built with a modern tech stack ensuring performance, scalability, and a premium user experience.

## 2. Technology Stack

### Project Phases & Roadmap
| Phase | Scope | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1** | Core ERP, Org, HRMS, ESSP, CRM | ✅ Completed |
| **Phase 2** | Inventory + WMS + Accounting (Foundation) | ✅ Core Completed |
| **Phase 3** | Manufacturing (MRP) | 🔄 In Progress |
| **Phase 4** | Procurement & Sales | 📅 Planned |
| **Phase 5** | Advanced Finance, Analytics, Integrations | 📅 Planned |

### Key Architectural Highlights
- **Supabase RPC:** All critical business logic (Inventory moves, posting journals, payroll) resides in database functions for consistency and performance.
- **Strict RLS:** Multi-tenancy is enforced at the database row level.
- **Inventory-First Accounting:** Financial entries are downstream effects of operational actions (e.g., Goods Receipt triggers Asset recognition).
- **Deterministic Engines:** Payroll and Inventory Valuation (FIFO) are calculated typically, not heuristically.

## 3. Core Architectural Concepts

### A. Document Lifecycle Model
The ERP operates on documents, ensuring a clear audit trail. Most transactional documents follow this lifecycle:
- **Draft:** Editable, no impact on stock or ledger.
- **Confirmed:** Validated, reserves stock/budget.
- **Posted:** Finalized, updates ledgers/stock, immutable.
- **Locked/Closed:** Period closed, no further actions.
- **Reversed:** CORRECTING entry created (original never deleted).

### B. Module Contracts & Data Flow
To prevent circular dependencies and ensuring data integrity:
1.  **Manufacturing $\rightarrow$ Inventory:** MRP does *not* update stock directly. It calls Inventory RPCs (`issue_material`, `receive_finished_good`).
2.  **CRM $\rightarrow$ Inventory $\rightarrow$ Accounting:**
    - CRM (Sales Order) $\rightarrow$ Inventory (Reservation/Delivery) $\rightarrow$ Accounting (Invoice + COGS).
    - CRM never posts directly to accounting.
3.  **Inventory $\rightarrow$ Accounting:** Stock movements trigger financial journal entries automatically.

### C. Unified Workflow Engine (`lib/WorkflowEngine.ts`)
A centralized, multi-step approval engine that governs critical business actions:
- **Trigger-Based:** Workflows are matched by `trigger_type` (e.g., `LEAVE_REQUEST`, `RESIGNATION`, `EXPENSE_CLAIM`).
- **Multi-Step:** Supports sequential approval steps with `workflow_steps` ordering.
- **Smart Assignment:** Auto-assigns to the employee's `manager_id` for manager-level steps, or to a role for role-based steps.
- **Action Logging:** Every approve/reject action is recorded in `workflow_action_logs` for full audit trail.
- **Entity Finalization:** On completion, the engine automatically updates the source record (e.g., sets leave status to `Approved`).
- **Covers:** Leave Requests, Resignations, Expense Claims, Stock Adjustments, Journal Reversals, Production Orders, Vendor Bill Approvals.

### D. Reporting Platform
Reporting is metadata-driven, allowing for:
- Saved, reusable report configurations.
- Cross-module data blending.
- Dynamic date ranges and drill-down capabilities.
